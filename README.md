# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Using the Kickstarter data to visualize trends about campaign outcomes.

### Purpose

To compare different campaigns and how they faired based on different metrics such as launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

See the screenshots for the analysis of the most successful dates and goals for outcomes.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The number of successful outcomes seems to hover between 60 and 70 until May when they skyrocket to around 110 and then slowly decline throughout the summer months and into the fall months as they hit their lowest point, expectedly, in the winter months. Failed outcomes tends be a bit more conssitent through out the year with a small spike in May also likely because there are many more theater production during that time.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Based on the data, outcomes tend to be more successful when the goal is at its lowest. Successful outcomes decreases until the 30000 mark but decline quickly after 45000. Failed outcomes has almost the opposite trjectory, increasing as the goal increases until the 25000 mark and then decreasing until 45000 then rapidly increasing from there.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Not many challenges or diffulties encounter except to sort through the data effictively to produce an accurate analysis.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

It is obvious from the visualization of the data that May is the most successful month for outcomes followed closely by June and July. It can also be concluded that December is the worst month with failed and successful outcomes virtually even.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Smaller goals tend to be more successful. <10000 has the greatest margin from successful and failed.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

This data set is pretty select and there are probably more factors to successful and failed outcomes than launch dates and goals.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We could create another table and/or graph considering country and how that affects the outcomes based on launch dates and goals.
